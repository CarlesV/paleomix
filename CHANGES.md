Current
=============
  * Check that regions of interest specified in PhylogeneticInference section
    corresponds to those specified earlier in the makefile.
  * Fixed a bug preventing new tasks from being started immediately after a
    task had failed; new tasks would only be started once a task had finished,
    or no running tasks were left.
  * Fixed MaxDepth calculation being limited to depths in the range 0 .. 200.
  * Added the ability to automatically read MaxReadDepth values from
    depth-histograms generated by the BAM pipeline to the genotyping step.
  * Added workaround for bug in Pysam, which caused parsing of some GTF files
    to fail if these contained unquoted values (e.g. "exon_number 2;").


Version 1.0.1 - 2014-04-30
==========================
  * Add 'paleomix' command, which provides interface for the various tools
    included in the PALEOMIX pipeline; this reduces the number of executables
    exposed by the pipeline, and allows for prerequisite checks to be done in
    one place.
  * Reworking version checking; add checks for JRE version (1.6+), for GATK
    (to check that the JRE can run it), and improved error messages for
    unidentified and / or outdated versions, and reporting of version numbers
    and requirements.
  * Dispose of hsperfdata_* folders created by certain JREs when using a
    custom temporary directory, when running Picard tools.
  * Cleanup of error-message displayed if Pysam version is outdated.
  * Ensure that file-handles are closed in the main process before subprocess
    execution, to ensure that these recieve SIGPIPE upon broken pipes.
  * Fix manifest, ensuring that all files are included in source distribution.
  * Fix regression in coverage / depths, which would fail if invoked for
    specific regions of interest.
  * Fix bug preventing Padding from being set to zero when genotyping.
  * Improvements to handling of implicit empty lists in makefiles; it is now
    no longer required to explicitly specify an empty list. Thus, the following
    is equivalent assuming that the pipeline expects a list:
      ExplicitEmptyList: []
      ImplicitEmptyList:
  * Added warning if HomozygousContigs contains contigs not included in any of
    the prefixes specified in the makefile.
  * Tweak makefile templates; the phylo makefile now specifies Male/Female
    genders with chrM and chrX; for the BAM pipeline the ROIs sub-tree and
    Label is commented out by default, as these are optional.
  * Reduced start-up time for bigger pipelines.


Version 1.0.0 - 2014-04-16
==========================
  * Switching to more traditional version-number tracking.
