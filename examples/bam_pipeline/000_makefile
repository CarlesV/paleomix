# Default options.
# Can also be specific for a set of samples, libraries, and lanes,
# by including the "Options" hierarchy at the same level as those
# samples, libraries, or lanes below. This does not include
# "Features", which may only be specific globally.
Options:
  # Sequencing platform, see SAM/BAM reference for valid values
  Platform: Illumina
  # Quality offset for PHRED scores, either 33 (Sanger/Illumina 1.8+) or 64 (Illumina 1.3+ / 1.5+)
  # For Bowtie2 it is also possible to specify 'Solexa', to handle reads on the Solexa scale.
  # This is used during adapter-trimming (AdapterRemoval) and sequence alignment (BWA/Bowtie2)
  QualityOffset: 33
  # Split a lane into multiple entries, one for each (pair of) file(s) found using the search-
  # string specified for a given lane. Each lane is named by adding a number to the end of the
  # given barcode.
  SplitLanesByFilenames: no
  # Compression format used when storing FASTQ files (either 'gz' for GZip or 'bz2' for BZip2)
  CompressionFormat: bz2


  # Settings for aligners supported by the pipeline
  AdapterRemoval:
    # Which version of AdapterRemoval to use ('v1.4' or 'v1.5+')
    Version: v1.5+

  Aligners:
    # Choice of aligner software to use, either "BWA" or "Bowtie2"
    Program: BWA

    # Settings for mappings performed using BWA
    BWA:
      # Filter hits with a mapping quality (PHRED) below this value
      MinQuality: 30
      # Should be disabled ("no") for aDNA alignments, as post-mortem localizes
      # to the seed region, which BWA expects to have few errors. Sets "-l".
      # See Schubert et al. 2012: http://pmid.us/22574660
      UseSeed:    yes
      # Additional command-line options may be specified for the "aln" call(s), as
      # described below for Bowtie2.

    # Settings for mappings performed using Bowtie2
    Bowtie2:
      # Filter hits with a mapping quality (PHRED) below this value
      MinQuality: 0
      # Examples of how to add additional command-line options
#      --trim5: 5
#      --trim3: 5
      # Note that the colon is required, even if no value is specified

  # Filter PCR duplicates
  # Collapsed reads are filtered using Martin Kirchers FilterUnique,
  # while other reads are filtered using Picard MarkDuplicates.
  PCRDuplicates: yes
  # Carry out quality base re-scaling using mapDamage (*EXPERIMENTAL*)
  RescaleQualities: no

  # For this project, we exclude reads that are unlikely to be ancient, namely
  # reads that do not overlap (= large template).
  ExcludeReads:
#    - Single    # Single-ended reads, or PE reads where one mate was discarded
    - Paired    # Pair-ended reads, where both reads were retained
#    - Collapsed # Overlapping pair-ended mate reads collapsed into a single read
#    - CollapsedTruncated # Like 'Collapsed', except that the reads have been
#                           truncated due to the presence of low quality bases.
#                           AdapterRemoval 1.5+ only.


  # Optional steps to perform during processing
  # To disable all features, replace with line "Features: []"
  Features:
#    - Raw BAM        # Generate BAM from the raw libraries (no indel realignment)
                     #   Location: {Destination}/{Target}.{Genome}.bam
    - Realigned BAM  # Generate indel-realigned BAM using the GATK Indel realigner
                     #   Location: {Destination}/{Target}.{Genome}.realigned.bam
    - mapDamage      # Generate mapDamage plot for each (unrealigned) library
                     #   Location: {Destination}/{Target}.{Genome}.mapDamage/{Library}/
    - Coverage       # Generate coverage information for the raw BAM (wo/ indel realignment)
                     #   Location: {Destination}/{Target}.{Genome}.coverage
    - Depths         # Generate histogram of number of sites with a given read-depth
                     #   Location: {Destination}/{Target}.{Genome}.depths
    - Summary        # Generate target summary (uses statistics from raw BAM)
                     #   Location: {Destination}/{Target}.summary
